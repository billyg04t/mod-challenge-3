## Credits

I used SnapChat's "My AI" program to help out with semantic issues regarding password generations in Javascript as well as declaring "const" for the generator's logic.

Modules 3 and 4 of the Vanderbilt Full Stack Web Development Program were referenced in the Javascript Code.

The starter code came from friendly-parakeet's git lab.
